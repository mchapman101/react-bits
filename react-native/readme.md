this readme is actually just notes, yo.

'view' would be any sorta container, basically.

touchablewhatever means making touch-friendly shiz.

basically react-native is all about iOS, and building on macs.

there's not much support for android, very little indeed for windows, and
probably less for linux. so. y'know.

gonna make this kind of a todo with goals and shiz or something, i dunno.
we'll see.

css is limited in react native. the only layout is flexbox here. react
native's default is by column, rather than by row.

building:
`react-native-bundle --platform=(android|ios) --entry-file=index.(ios|android).js --bundle-output=(app-file)`

requires a large amount of setup to actually do the building, and i don't
have java on this computer at all because screw that, so i won't be doing
that, basically.
