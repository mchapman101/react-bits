* To get started learning React, I _highly_ recomment [this course](http://survivejs.com)
* [This is another very good beginner's course](http://reactjsprogram.teachable.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals).
* You'll need to get comfortable with ES2016, ASAP. [Here's a repo](https://github.com/zacanger/es6-and-builds) I put
  together for that.

* You may want to take a moment to get your editor comfortable with JSX.
  * For Atom, `apm install react language-babel`.
  * For Sublime Text, search for `Babel` in Package Control.
  * For VS Code, `tsd install react-global` or `typings install --ambient react-global`
* Some JSX gotchas:
  * Don't try to comment your JSX.
  * Don't try `if` statements in your JSX.
  * All tags must be closed (including void tags like `hr` and `img`).
    * But, all tags can be _self_ closing (eg `<div />`), which is nice.
* There are some really nifty DevTools extensions for working with React:
  * [Show Me The React](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/show-me-the-react/iaebolhfcmodobkanmaahdhnlplncbnd)
  * [Official React DevTools Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
  * [Official Tools Addon for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)
* Some additional React resources:
  * `npm i -g thinking-in-react` is a workshopper (interactive somewhat gamified tutorial in the terminal)
    * (and workshoppers are really great. react is neat, workshoppers are great, so this is swell.)
  * [lifecycle demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/JrdxRs?p=preview)
  * [official react jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/)
  * [unofficial react jsbin](http://jsbin.com/yafixat/edit?js,output)
